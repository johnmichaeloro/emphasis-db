    <h3>Here are a few tips for writing yellow sentences.</h3>
    <br><br>
    Bold Statements
    "It was over before it had begun."
    <br><br>
    Authors often use yellow sentences like this to start a story. Bold statements incite curiosity, compelling readers to read on. They also influence the sentences that follow them, casting their meaning like a shadow.
    <br><br>
    Short Descriptions of Action
    "He punched. He kicked. He stomped."
    <br><br>
    Unlike green and blue sentences, yellow sentences don't leave much of an impression. (They are just too simple.) But they make up for this in impact, shooting straight to the imagination like bullets. (Pow! Pow!) This makes them ideal for when an author needs to keep things moving quickly.

    Combining Sentences
    "None of the witnesses, not the judge, nor the bailiff, nor the prosecutor, would speak of it. Doing so would mean the end of their careers."
    <br><br>
    Notice how the bold yellow sentence provides a sense of definition for the mysterious green sentence?

    <h3>Here are a few tips for writing green sentences.</h3>
    <br><br>
    Evocative Descriptions
    "The sky was blue and the sun was shining above the empty streets, the shuttered stores, and the ruined houses."
    <br><br>
    Descriptions generally rely on concrete words, which amplify sentence-level emphasis because of how they are comprehended. This means that when you craft a description using a green sentence, the odds of producing an effect increase.

    Mysterious Statements
    "None of the witnesses, not the judge, nor the bailiff, nor the prosecutor, would speak of it."
    <br><br>
    The green sentence is the only kind that has sentence-wide emphasis. Because of this, the green sentence naturally produces a sense of expectation in readers. With the green sentence, we’re always waiting for what will come next, for the sign that will turn the green sentence into a blue sentence.

    Combining Sentences
    "The sky was blue and the sun was shining above the empty streets, the shuttered stores, and the ruined houses. She walked down the sidewalk beside her old apartment building, looking from one dark window to the next, wondering if anyone was left."
    <br><br>
    Combining a green sentence with a blue sentence can create a powerful effect. Notice how poignant the last words of the blue sentence are? That's because the green sentence left us expecting something more, and that something more became the blue sentence's final words.

    <h3>Here are a few tips for writing blue sentences.</h3>
    <br><br>
    Common Emphasis
    "They listened politely, nodding their heads in agreement, smiling with approval, not believing a word."
    <br><br>
    Among authors, it’s known that emphasis naturally appears at the beginning and end of a sentence. In this sentence, an effect was created by reversing the reader’s expectations in the dark blue segment.
    <br><br>
    Amplified Emphasis
    "When the cleaning lady appeared at his door, the towel she gave Brad was as damp and rough as a cat’s tongue."
    <br><br>
    Emphasis can be amplified by placing a metaphor in the dark blue segment of a sentence. Because metaphors produce an effect of their own, aligning them with sentence-level emphasis can intensify that effect.
    <br><br>
    Combining Sentences
    "Though Frederick and Marjorie had owned the Bengal for years, they had never earned its trust. Pacing along the side of its cage and staring at its captors through the bars, the tiger licked its teeth."
    <br><br>
    Can you sense the tension in the dark blue segment of the second sentence? It was produced by the author’s use of concrete words like "cage," "bars," and "teeth." It was also produced by the concentrated emphasis that occurs in the dark blue segment of the sentence. The sense of expectancy generated by the green sentence helped to accentuate these effects.
